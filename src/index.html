						<p>The housing burden is real for China’s young people. As many young urban professionals worried, they may never be able to get onto the first rung of the property ladder. Prices are just too far out of reach.</p> 
						<p>Looking at all the property transactions from <a href = "https://bj.lianjia.com/">Lianjia.com</a> in Beijing in 2017, the year government and economists realized that they need to search for cures to runaway housing prices, we are able to explore the characteristics of Beijing property market and know how affordable it is to live there. Then we could have a better understanding of why making some new reform is in a hurry.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, economists face two main challenges: The housing sector is now one of China’s main pillars of growth – and government does not want to send prices tumbling. Also, people strongly believe property is the safest and most profitable place to store their money.

							<h3>What is the housing price - income ratio in Beijing?</h3>
							<br/><p>When talking about housing market, housing affordability really measures. The price to income ratio is the basic affordability measure for housing in a given area. It is generally the ratio of median house prices to median familial disposable incomes, expressed as a percentage or as years of income.</p>
							<p> According to <a href = "https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/05/where-the-house-price-to-income-ratio-is-most-out-of-whack/561404/">Citylab</a>, in Boston, for example, the ratio was 5.2, which means median housing price in Boston cost 2.6 times as much as the median annual income. However, in Beijing, the ratio was 40.3 in Dongcheng District in 2017. For the same year, Shijingshan District had the lowest one. </p>
